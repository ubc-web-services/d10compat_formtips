# Form Tips

Form Tips module uses JS to move form descriptions to tooltips.

It helps to reduce form clutter by removing form descriptions from the page and
only displaying them when needed.

## Examples

Please see the [screencast][1] showing how the Views 6.x *add fields form* looks
with this module enabled.
